<h1> Nextflow pipeline for bacterial whole genome sequence analysis </h1>

<h3>Quality control fo the raw sequencing data generated from the sequencing instrument to remove low-quality reads and adapter sequences.</h3>

   1). Trimmomatic: Used to remove adapter sequences, low-quality bases, and low-quality reads from sequencing reads. You can find more information and usage instructions on the Trimmomatic GitHub.

   2). FastQC: Used to assess the quality distribution and other quality metrics of sequencing reads. It helps detect potential issues during the sequencing process, such as decreasing sequencing quality and adapter contamination. For more information, please visit the FastQC website.
